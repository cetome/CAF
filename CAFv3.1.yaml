    description: You have the capability to enact your incident response plan, including effective limitation of impact on the operation of your essential function. During an incident, you have access to timely information on which to base your response decisions.
    IGP_not_achieved:
    - Inadequate arrangements have been made to make the right resources available to implement your response plan.
    - Your response team members are not equipped to make good response decisions and put them into effect.
    - Inadequate back-up mechanisms exist to allow the continued operation of your essential function during an incident.
    IGP_partially_achieved:
    - N/A
    IGP_achieved:
    - You understand the resources that will likely be needed to carry out any required response activities, and arrangements are in place to make these resources available.
    - You understand the types of information that will likely be needed to inform response decisions and arrangements are in place to make this information available.
    - Your response team members have the skills and knowledge required to decide on the response actions necessary to limit harm, and the authority to carry them out.
    - Key roles are duplicated, and operational delivery knowledge is shared with all individuals involved in the operations and recovery of the essential function.
    - Back-up mechanisms are available that can be readily activated to allow continued operation of your essential function (although possibly at a reduced level) if primary networks and information systems fail or are unavailable.
    - Arrangements exist to augment your organisation's incident response capabilities with external support if necessary (e.g. specialist cyber incident responders).

  D1.c:
    name: Testing and Exercising
    description: Your organisation carries out exercises to test response plans, using past incidents that affected your (and other) organisation, and scenarios that draw on threat intelligence and your risk assessment.
    IGP_not_achieved:
    - Exercises test only a discrete part of the process (e.g. that backups are working), but do not consider all areas.
    - Incident response exercises are not routinely carried out or are carried out in an ad-hoc way.
    - Outputs from exercises are not fed into the organisation's lessons learned process.
    - Exercises do not test all parts of the response cycle.
    IGP_partially_achieved:
    - N/A
    IGP_achieved:
    - Exercise scenarios are based on incidents experienced by your and other organisations or are composed using experience or threat intelligence.
    - Exercise scenarios are documented, regularly reviewed, and validated.
    - Exercises are routinely run, with the findings documented and used to refine incident response plans and protective security, in line with the lessons learned.
    - Exercises test all parts of your response cycle relating to your essential functions (e.g. restoration of normal function levels).

  D2.a:
    name: Incident Root Cause Analysis
    description: When an incident occurs, steps must be taken to understand its root causes and ensure appropriate remediating action is taken.
    IGP_not_achieved:
    - You are not usually able to resolve incidents to a root cause.
    - You do not have a formal process for investigating causes.
    IGP_partially_achieved:
    - N/A
    IGP_achieved:
    - Root cause analysis is conducted routinely as a key part of your lessons learned activities following an incident.
    - Your root cause analysis is comprehensive, covering organisational process issues, as well as vulnerabilities in your networks, systems or software.
    - All relevant incident data is made available to the analysis team to perform root cause analysis.

  D2.b:
    name: Using Incidents to Drive Improvements
    description: Your organisation uses lessons learned from incidents to improve your security measures.
    IGP_not_achieved:
    - Following incidents, lessons learned are not captured or are limited in scope.
    - Improvements arising from lessons learned following an incident are not implemented or not given sufficient organisational priority.
    IGP_partially_achieved:
    - N/A
    IGP_achieved:
    - You have a documented incident review process/policy which ensures that lessons learned from each incident are identified, captured, and acted upon.
    - Lessons learned cover issues with reporting, roles, governance, skills and organisational processes as well as technical aspects of networks and information systems.
    - You use lessons learned to improve security measures, including updating and retesting response plans when necessary.
    - Security improvements identified as a result of lessons learned are prioritised, with the highest priority improvements completed quickly.
    - Analysis is fed to senior management and incorporated into risk management and continuous improvement.
